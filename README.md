# US-accidents-analysis
I am using the US Accidents open dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset is a countrywide car accident dataset, covering 49 states of the US, collected from 2016 to 2021. Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset. This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. 
There are a total of 11 tasks covered in this notebook. These tasks are:
1.  Data Cleaning
2.  States and cities with most andl least accidents
3.  Year and month with most and least accidents
4.  Effect of weather on severity of an accident
5.  Effect of visibility on severity of an accident
6.  Effect of temperature on severity of an accident
7.  Map severity of accident to the location
8.  Data Preprocessing
9.  Splitting the train test sets
10. Logistic Regression Model
11. Decision Tree Model
